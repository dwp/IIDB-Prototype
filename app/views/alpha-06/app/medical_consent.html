      <!-- <h2 class="heading-medium">Professionals who know about your condition</h2> -->

      <p>As part of your application you'll be asked for details of professional people who know about your condition.</p>
      <p>This could include:</p>
      <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left:24px; margin-top: 12px; font-size:14pt;">
        <li>doctors</li>
        <li>pyhyisotherapists</li>
        <li>trade union representatives</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To deal with your claim faster DWP may ask these people directly for information about you. You won't have to name people you don't want to be contacted, just those you do.</p>
