        Before a decision can be made on your claim, we will need to make some more enquiries about your employment and medical history. You do not need to do anything else at the moment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        It may take up to 11 weeks to gather the information and for you to be assessed by a medical examiner if one is needed. It all depends on what sort of information we need and how quickly our enquiries are answered.

        <div class="panel panel-border-wide" >
          <p>
             It is very important that you attend the examination if applicable, failure to do so will cause delay in dealing with your claim 
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Do not worry if you do not hear from us for a while. Any delay will not affect the decision on your starting date or the amount of benefit you may be entitle to.</p>
